Project goals:
- Study and learn the swarm intelligence field.
- Study and learn general-purpose computing on graphics processing units.
- Study and learn CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) platform created by NVIDIA.
- Combine parallel processing with swarm intelligence agents.

For this purpose was taken as example the Gravitational Search Algorithm (by Esmat Rashedi), and was implemented under CUDA 4.0.
